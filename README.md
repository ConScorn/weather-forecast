# weather-forecast

## Description
This app is designed to give the user the weather data of any city of their choice, for the next six days. When a city name is entered into the input on the left side, The user will be presented with the date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and a small icon representing that day's weather. My motivation for completing this assingment was to better understand API calls, and practice using local storage.

## Usage
See the deployed site: https://conscorn.github.io/weather-forecast/
Clone the repository: https://github.com/ConScorn/weather-forecast
To use the app, enter a city into the input on the left, and click 'Search'. That's all!

## Unfortunately, due to time constraints, a few things do not work properly: 

- The 'past searches' buttons are generated based on past searches in local storage, but are not clickable
- The weather for the current day does not give a UV index

Despite much effort to implement these, I was unable to, and will return at a later date to do so.

## Technologies Used:
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- Open Weather API's: 
    Current Weather API

- HTML
- CSS
